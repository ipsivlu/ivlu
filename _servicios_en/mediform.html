    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="highlight-list">
      <p><span>01</span><strong>How much weight can I lose per week?</strong><br>
      A healthy range is between 0.5 and 1 kg per week. This helps preserve muscle mass and reduces the risk of rebound.</p>
      <p><span>02</span><strong>Do I need to exercise?</strong><br>
      Yes. Physical activity is key to boosting your metabolism, maintaining weight loss, regulating mood, and protecting cardiovascular health. We include practical home routines using resistance bands.</p>
      <p><span>03</span><strong>Do fats make you gain weight?</strong><br>
      Not all of them. Healthy fats (like avocado, nuts, olive oil) are essential for your body. At Mediforma, we teach you how to integrate them wisely and without fear.</p>
      <p><span>04</span><strong>How can I avoid rebound weight gain?</strong><br>
      By educating yourself and building sustainable habits. Our multidisciplinary approach is designed to help you maintain your results with nutritional, psychological, and medical support.</p>
      <p><span>05</span><strong>What happens if I stop using medications like Ozempic or Saxenda?</strong><br>
      Stopping them abruptly may increase appetite or cause setbacks. That‚Äôs why, at Mediforma, their use is planned and supervised as part of a holistic treatment ‚Äî never as a standalone solution.</p>
      <p><span>06</span><strong>How do sleep and stress affect my weight?</strong><br>
      Poor sleep and high stress raise cortisol levels and disrupt hunger hormones. At Mediforma, we address this with psychological support, emotional management techniques, and lifestyle adjustments.</p>
      <p><span>07</span><strong>What if I hit a plateau during the process?</strong><br>
      It‚Äôs totally normal. At Mediforma, we make strategic adjustments and support you with new tools in nutrition, motivation, and movement to help you push through.</p>
