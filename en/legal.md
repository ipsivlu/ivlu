## International Medical Services Notice

The medical services provided through Dr. Tatiana Leal's Aesthetic Medicine Center are exclusively performed at our facilities located in Bogotá, Colombia. Our medical practice operates under and is governed by Colombian healthcare laws, regulations, and standards. This international notice serves to provide clarity and understanding for patients traveling from abroad, particularly those from the United States and other countries.

The provision of our medical services is subject to and regulated by comprehensive Colombian healthcare legislation, including but not limited to the General Health Law (Law 100 of 1993), specific regulations governing aesthetic medicine practices, and all applicable health and safety standards established by the Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection. Our center maintains full compliance with these regulations while striving to meet international standards of medical care.

International patients must understand and acknowledge several crucial aspects of receiving medical treatment in Colombia. First and foremost, all medical procedures are performed exclusively in our Colombian facilities and adhere strictly to Colombian medical regulations, protocols, and standards of care. These standards may differ from those in other countries, including the United States, and patients should familiarize themselves with these differences before proceeding with any treatment.

Our medical practice operates under licenses and certifications issued by Colombian health authorities, which may have different requirements and standards compared to other countries. While we maintain high standards of care that often meet or exceed international expectations, the legal framework governing our practice is Colombian law.

A critical consideration for international patients is that any medical malpractice claims or legal disputes arising from services provided would be governed by and adjudicated under Colombian law. This means that any legal proceedings would take place in Colombian courts, following Colombian legal procedures and standards. International patients should be aware that this may affect their legal rights and remedies compared to receiving treatment in their home country.

Furthermore, insurance coverage from international insurance providers, including U.S.-based insurance companies, may not extend to procedures performed in Colombia. Patients are strongly advised to:
- Verify their insurance coverage for international medical procedures
- Consider purchasing additional medical travel insurance
- Understand the limitations and exclusions of their insurance policies
- Make arrangements for payment according to our center's financial policies

## Professional Qualifications and Center Certifications

Dr. Tatiana Leal's Aesthetic Medicine Center maintains a comprehensive system of professional qualifications and certifications that meets and exceeds all requirements established by Colombian healthcare authorities. Our commitment to excellence is demonstrated through our strict adherence to national and international standards of medical practice, professional development, and facility management.

Our center operates in full compliance with Resolution 2263 of 2004, which establishes the requirements for the operation of aesthetic centers in Colombia. This compliance encompasses all aspects of our facility, including infrastructure, equipment, personnel qualifications, and safety protocols. We maintain strict adherence to Resolution 2827 of 2006, which governs biosafety protocols in aesthetic establishments, ensuring the highest standards of safety and hygiene in all our procedures.

The professional licensing of our medical staff is maintained in accordance with Colombian regulations, which require regular renewal and continuous professional development. Each member of our medical team possesses valid and current professional credentials issued by recognized Colombian medical institutions and regulatory bodies. These credentials are subject to regular verification and renewal processes to ensure ongoing compliance with all applicable regulations.

Our facility undergoes regular inspections and maintains all required certifications from relevant Colombian health authorities. These certifications cover various aspects of our operation, including:

The physical infrastructure of our medical center, which is designed and maintained to meet all safety and accessibility requirements. Our medical equipment and technology, which is regularly inspected, calibrated, and certified for medical use.

## Privacy and Data Protection

### International Data Protection Standards

The protection of patient privacy and personal information stands as a fundamental principle at Dr. Tatiana Leal's Aesthetic Medicine Center. Our privacy framework is primarily governed by Colombian Law 1581 of 2012 (Personal Data Protection Law) and its implementing regulations, which establish comprehensive requirements for the collection, processing, and protection of personal data. While operating under Colombian law, we have implemented additional measures that align with international privacy standards to ensure the highest level of data protection for our international patients.

For patients traveling from the United States, we acknowledge and incorporate relevant principles from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) as a reference for best practices in medical privacy. Although our operations are not directly subject to HIPAA regulations, we have voluntarily adopted many of its security and privacy standards to provide enhanced protection for our international patients' information. This approach ensures that our privacy practices meet or exceed the expectations of patients accustomed to stringent privacy protections in their home countries.

Our comprehensive data protection system incorporates multiple layers of security and control measures. Electronic medical records are maintained in secure, encrypted databases accessible only to authorized personnel through multi-factor authentication systems. All data transmission, whether within our facility or with authorized external parties, is protected through advanced encryption protocols that meet international standards for secure data transfer.

Access to patient information is strictly controlled through a hierarchical permission system, with each staff member having access only to the information necessary for their specific role. This access is monitored and logged, creating an audit trail of all interactions with patient data. Regular reviews of these access logs help ensure compliance with our privacy policies and detect any unauthorized access attempts.

Our staff undergoes comprehensive privacy training upon hiring and participates in regular refresher courses to maintain awareness of privacy requirements and best practices. This training covers both Colombian privacy laws and international privacy standards, ensuring our team understands and implements appropriate privacy protection measures in their daily activities.

Regular security audits are conducted by both internal and external specialists to verify the effectiveness of our privacy protection measures and identify any potential vulnerabilities. These audits encompass all aspects of our data protection system, including technical infrastructure, administrative procedures, and staff compliance with privacy protocols.

### Medical Records and Documentation

The management of medical records at our center follows a strict protocol designed to ensure accuracy, completeness, and confidentiality while maintaining accessibility for authorized purposes. All medical records are maintained in accordance with Colombian regulations, particularly Resolution 1995 of 1999, which establishes the standards for medical documentation in Colombia. These standards are supplemented by international best practices to ensure comprehensive and accurate medical record-keeping.

Each patient's medical record contains detailed documentation of all interactions with our center, including but not limited to consultation notes, treatment plans, procedure records, clinical photographs, post-procedure follow-up notes, and any communication related to their care. These records are maintained in both digital and physical formats, with appropriate security measures for each format.

Patient rights regarding their medical records are clearly defined and protected. Every patient has the right to access their complete medical record, receive detailed explanations of its contents, and request copies of their documentation. Such requests are processed through a formal procedure that verifies the patient's identity and authority to access the information while maintaining security and confidentiality.

For international patients, we provide additional services to ensure effective access to and understanding of their medical records. All documentation can be provided in both Spanish and English, with certified translations available upon request. This bilingual approach ensures that international patients can fully understand and utilize their medical records, whether for their personal reference or for sharing with healthcare providers in their home country.

The transfer of medical records to other healthcare providers, when authorized by the patient, follows a secure and standardized protocol. This includes verification of the receiving provider's credentials, secure transmission of the information, and confirmation of receipt. All such transfers are documented in the patient's record to maintain a complete chain of custody for their medical information.

## Informed Consent and Patient Rights

### Comprehensive Information

The principle of informed consent stands as a cornerstone of our medical practice, reflecting our commitment to patient autonomy and ethical healthcare delivery. At Dr. Tatiana Leal's Aesthetic Medicine Center, we implement a comprehensive informed consent process that ensures each patient receives complete, accurate, and understandable information about their proposed treatment or procedure.

Every patient has the fundamental right to receive detailed information about all aspects of their medical care. This information encompasses the nature and purpose of proposed treatments, alternative treatment options available, potential risks and complications associated with each option, expected outcomes and their limitations, the recovery process and required post-procedure care, and all associated costs and payment terms. This information is presented in a clear, systematic manner that allows patients to make informed decisions about their healthcare.

The presentation of medical information follows a structured approach designed to ensure thorough understanding. Each consultation begins with a detailed assessment of the patient's concerns and objectives, followed by a comprehensive explanation of available treatment options. Our medical professionals utilize various educational tools, including anatomical models, before-and-after photographs (with appropriate patient consent), and detailed written materials to facilitate understanding of proposed procedures.

For our international patients, particular attention is paid to ensuring clear communication across language barriers. All critical information is provided in both Spanish and English, with professional medical interpreters available when needed. This bilingual approach extends to all aspects of patient communication, from initial consultation through post-procedure care instructions.

Cost information is presented with complete transparency, including detailed breakdowns of all fees associated with proposed treatments. This includes not only the direct costs of medical procedures but also any additional fees for supplies, medications, follow-up care, or potential additional treatments that may be needed. For international patients, we provide clear information about payment methods, currency conversion considerations, and any additional costs specific to international care.

### Explicit Consent Process

Our informed consent process goes beyond mere documentation to ensure genuine understanding and voluntary agreement to proposed treatments. Written informed consent is required for all procedures, with the consent process designed to be thorough, clear, and appropriately documented.

For international patients, we have developed a specialized consent process that accounts for cultural and linguistic differences. Consent forms are provided in both English and Spanish, with the English version carefully translated to ensure accuracy while maintaining clarity. The consent documents are structured to be comprehensive yet understandable, avoiding technical jargon where possible and including clear explanations of medical terms when necessary.

Adequate time is allocated for document review, with our medical staff available to answer questions and provide additional explanations as needed. We encourage patients to take the time they need to review consent documents thoroughly, ask questions, and consider their decisions carefully. This may include taking the documents home for review or discussing them with family members or other healthcare providers.

The consent process includes multiple opportunities for questions and clarification. Our medical staff is trained to verify understanding through interactive discussion, encouraging patients to ask questions and express any concerns. This dialogue is documented as part of the consent process, ensuring that patient comprehension is confirmed and recorded.

We emphasize that consent is an ongoing process rather than a one-time event. Patients are informed of their right to withdraw consent at any time before the procedure, without prejudice to their future care. Any modifications to the treatment plan after initial consent require additional discussion and documentation of continued consent.

The documentation of consent includes:
- Written authorization for the specific procedure(s) to be performed
- Acknowledgment of discussion of risks and benefits
- Confirmation of understanding of alternative treatments
- Recognition of the opportunity to ask questions
- Agreement to follow post-procedure care instructions
- Understanding of financial responsibilities

## Payment and Refund Policy for International Patients

### Payment Terms

The financial policies of Dr. Tatiana Leal's Aesthetic Medicine Center have been carefully structured to accommodate the unique needs of our international patient population while maintaining clear and consistent financial practices. All fees for medical services are denominated and must be paid in Colombian Pesos (COP), the official currency of Colombia, in accordance with Colombian financial regulations.

While we provide approximate conversions to major international currencies, particularly US Dollars and Euros, for the convenience of our international patients, it is essential to understand that these conversions are provided for reference purposes only. The actual cost in foreign currencies will vary based on prevailing exchange rates at the time of payment. Exchange rates fluctuate daily in international currency markets, and the final amount charged in your local currency will be determined by the exchange rate applied by your financial institution at the time the transaction is processed.

International transactions may incur additional fees beyond the cost of medical services. These may include, but are not limited to, international transaction fees charged by credit card companies, typically ranging from 1% to 3% of the transaction amount; currency conversion fees applied by financial institutions; and potential intermediary bank charges for wire transfers. These additional charges are imposed by financial institutions and are not under the control of our medical center.

To facilitate payment for our international patients, we accept multiple payment methods, including:
- Major international credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express)
- International wire transfers to our designated Colombian bank account
- Local bank transfers for patients with Colombian bank accounts
- Other specified payment methods as agreed upon in advance

Payment timing and arrangements must be confirmed prior to scheduling any procedures. For major procedures, a deposit may be required to secure the appointment, with the balance due according to the payment schedule provided in your treatment agreement. All payment terms, including deposits, payment schedules, and refund conditions, will be clearly documented in writing before any financial commitment is required.

### Refund Policy

Our refund policy has been developed with careful consideration of both patient needs and operational requirements, with specific provisions for international patients who may face additional complexities in planning their medical travel. This policy aims to be fair and transparent while protecting both patient interests and the center's ability to maintain efficient scheduling of medical services.

Procedure cancellations are handled according to a structured timeline that considers the advance notice provided:

In cases where the center cancels a procedure for any reason, including but not limited to medical concerns identified during pre-procedure evaluation, emergency facility maintenance, or physician unavailability, a full refund of 100% of any amounts paid will be processed. Such refunds will be initiated within two business days of the cancellation notification and processed through the original payment method when possible.

For patient-initiated cancellations made more than 14 days before the scheduled procedure date, 90% of the amount paid will be refunded. This policy allows the center to retain a small administrative fee to cover costs already incurred in preparation for the procedure while ensuring patients recover the majority of their payment if plans must change well in advance.

Cancellations made between 7 and 14 days before the scheduled procedure will result in a 50% refund of amounts paid. This partial refund reflects the increased difficulty of rescheduling the allocated time and resources with shorter notice, while still providing some financial consideration to patients who must cancel.

For cancellations made less than 7 days before the scheduled procedure, refunds are not typically provided, except in cases of documented medical emergencies or other extraordinary circumstances that will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. This policy reflects the significant difficulty of reallocating medical resources and scheduling other patients with very short notice.

### Travel Considerations

Given the international nature of our practice, it is important to establish clear policies regarding travel-related aspects of medical care. Our center explicitly does not reimburse any travel-related expenses, including but not limited to airline tickets, hotel accommodations, ground transportation, or other travel arrangements, regardless of the reason for procedure cancellation or rescheduling. This policy applies even in cases where the center must cancel or reschedule a procedure.

We strongly recommend that all international patients obtain comprehensive travel insurance that specifically covers medical tourism. Such insurance should ideally include coverage for trip cancellation or interruption, medical complications, and extended stay requirements. While we can provide documentation to support insurance claims, including official letters confirming medical appointments or procedure schedules, we cannot guarantee that insurance providers will cover any specific expenses or claims.

## International Travel and Medical Procedures

### Pre-Travel Requirements

The success and safety of medical procedures for international patients requires careful preparation and coordination. Before traveling to Colombia for medical procedures, patients must complete a comprehensive pre-travel preparation process designed to ensure both their safety and the efficiency of their medical care.

Medical Documentation Requirements:
All international patients must complete and submit detailed medical history forms prior to travel.

Our medical team will specifically assess factors such as swelling, discomfort levels, and overall patient mobility to ensure safe travel conditions.

Any potential complications have been definitively ruled out through appropriate medical examination and, when necessary, diagnostic testing. This may include laboratory studies, imaging, or other medical evaluations as deemed appropriate by our medical team based on the specific procedures performed and the patient's individual healing progression.

The patient demonstrates full understanding of and ability to comply with post-procedure care instructions during travel. This includes proper wound care, medication management, activity restrictions, and any specific precautions necessary during air travel or other forms of transportation.
