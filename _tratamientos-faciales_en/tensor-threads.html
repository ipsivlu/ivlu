faqs:
  - pregunta: How long does the procedure take?
    respuesta: The treatment typically takes 30-45 minutes, depending on the number of threads and areas being treated. Many of our patients schedule it during their lunch break
  - pregunta: Is the treatment painful?
    respuesta: We use local anesthesia to ensure your comfort throughout the procedure. Most patients describe feeling only a mild sensation of pressure
  - pregunta: How long do the results last?
    respuesta: Results typically last between 12-18 months, depending on the type of threads used and your skin's condition. The collagen stimulation provides ongoing improvement

  <div class="block_section_content">
    <p>Sarah, a 45-year-old executive from Boston, was frustrated with her reflection. Despite a healthy lifestyle, she noticed her jawline softening and those stubborn marionette lines deepening. Like many of our international patients, she wanted rejuvenation without surgery. <strong>PDO threads</strong> offered exactly what she was looking for - a lunch-break procedure with natural-looking results. This innovative technology not only lifts and tightens but also kickstarts your skin's natural collagen production. Imagine looking refreshed and naturally youthful, without anyone knowing you've had anything done!</p>
