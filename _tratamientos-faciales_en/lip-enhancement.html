faqs:
  - pregunta: Is the procedure painful?
    respuesta: Your comfort is our priority. The procedure is very comfortable thanks to topical and local anesthesia. Most patients report only feeling slight pressure during treatment, making it an easily tolerable experience
  - pregunta: How long do the results last?
    respuesta: Lip enhancement results typically last 8-12 months, depending on your metabolism. You can maintain your results with scheduled touch-up sessions. Many patients find their results last longer with subsequent treatments
  - pregunta: Can I return to my normal routine after?
    respuesta: Absolutely! You can return to most daily activities immediately. While you might experience mild swelling for 24-48 hours, many patients schedule treatments during lunch breaks and return to work the same day
  - pregunta: Will my results look natural?
    respuesta: Our philosophy centers on creating natural-looking results that enhance your beauty without changing your essence. We work with your unique facial proportions to ensure your lips look beautiful and in perfect harmony with your features

Like many of our international patients, she discovered that <strong>lip enhancement</strong> with premium dermal fillers could deliver exactly what she wanted: subtle, elegant enhancement that amplifies her natural beauty. This innovative treatment not only adds volume but also defines lip contours and balances facial proportions. Imagine waking up every morning with perfectly defined, natural-looking lips - no lip liner needed!
