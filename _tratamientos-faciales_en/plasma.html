faqs:
  - pregunta: How many sessions will I need?
    respuesta: The number of sessions varies depending on the treatment area and your specific goals. Generally, we recommend 3-4 initial sessions, spaced 3-4 weeks apart. Hair restoration may require a more extensive protocol. During your complimentary consultation, we'll design a personalized plan
  - pregunta: Is the treatment painful?
    respuesta: The treatment is very comfortable. The blood draw is minimal, similar to a routine blood test. We use topical anesthesia and specialized techniques for the application to minimize any discomfort. Many patients schedule treatments during their lunch break
  - pregunta: How long do results last?
    respuesta: Results are progressive and long-lasting as they stimulate your body's natural regeneration processes. Many patients find their results improve with subsequent treatments. We recommend maintenance sessions every 6-12 months to optimize results
  - pregunta: Is PRP safe?
    respuesta: Yes, PRP is extraordinarily safe because it uses your own growth factors. As an autologous treatment (using your own blood), there's no risk of rejection or allergic reactions. It's one of the safest regenerative treatments available

  <div class="block_section_content">
    <p>
      "Is there really a 100% natural treatment that works?" wondered Amanda, a 42-year-old tech executive from Seattle, while looking at her bathroom cabinet full of expensive serums and supplements that promised miracles. Like many busy professionals, she was tired of investing in products that didn't deliver and was searching for a scientifically-backed treatment that would harness her body's own resources.

      <strong>Platelet-rich plasma (PRP)</strong> changed everything. This innovative treatment uses growth factors from your own blood to stimulate natural skin and hair regeneration. Think of it as taking your body's natural healing and rejuvenating tools and concentrating them exactly where you need them most - like giving your skin's repair system a powerful upgrade.

    <h3 id="precio-section">The science behind natural regeneration</h3>
    <p>While most treatments introduce foreign substances into your body, <strong>PRP</strong> works with your own growth factors. It's like creating a supercharged version of the regenerative elements your body naturally produces. The result is deep, lasting regeneration that progressively improves - essentially biohacking your body's own healing capabilities.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>During your complimentary consultation, we'll analyze your specific needs and design a customized protocol to maximize PRP benefits. We'll explain exactly how your own growth factors will work to achieve the regeneration you desire, and can help coordinate your visit if you're traveling from abroad.</p>

    <h2 id="experiencia-section">Your PRP experience</h2>
    <p>Treatment begins with a small blood draw, similar to a routine lab test. While we process your plasma using state-of-the-art technology, we apply topical anesthesia to ensure your comfort. The entire session takes about 45 minutes, during which our specialists work precisely to apply PRP to strategic points.</p>
    <p>Most patients are surprised by how comfortable and quick the procedure is. You might experience slight redness that resolves within 24-48 hours - perfect for a Thursday treatment to have glowing skin for the weekend. The results continue to improve over the following weeks as your growth factors work their magic.</p>
