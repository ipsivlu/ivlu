faqs:
  - pregunta: What types of peels are available?
    respuesta: We offer three types of peels. Superficial peels working at 0.06mm depth for gentle renewal, medium peels reaching 0.45-0.6mm perfect for spots and texture, and deep peels at 0.6-0.8mm for cases requiring more intensity. During your consultation, we'll determine the most suitable option for you
  - pregunta: Is the treatment painful?
    respuesta: The procedure causes minimal discomfort. You might experience a slight tingling or warming sensation during application, which is controlled with our comfort protocol. Most patients describe the experience as very tolerable
  - pregunta: How long is the recovery?
    respuesta: Recovery time varies by peel type. Superficial peels require 3-4 days, medium peels 5-7 days, and deep peels up to 14 days. We'll provide you with a detailed post-treatment care protocol
  - pregunta: When will I see results?
    respuesta: You'll notice immediate improvement in your skin's radiance. Optimal results develop over the following weeks as your skin regenerates, with notable improvement in texture, tone, and pigmentation

    respuesta: Yes, we customize the type and concentration of the peel according to your skin type and specific needs. Our preliminary evaluation ensures a safe and effective treatment for each patient
