faqs:
  - pregunta: Is the removal procedure painful?
    respuesta: The sensation varies from person to person, but most of our patients describe it as less uncomfortable than getting the original tattoo. We use a special numbing cream, and our Q-Switched laser technology is designed to maximize your comfort during treatment
  - pregunta: How long does it take for the tattoo to disappear?
    respuesta: Each tattoo is unique, but you'll typically see notable results after 3-4 sessions. The complete process depends on factors like size, colors used, and tattoo age. During your consultation, we can give you a more precise estimate based on your specific characteristics
  - pregunta: What types of tattoos can be removed?
    respuesta: Our Q-Switched laser technology is effective for most tattoos, being especially efficient with black, blue, and red pigments. Even older tattoos or those that other clinics have considered difficult can be successfully treated with our personalized protocol
  - pregunta: Will there be any scarring?
    respuesta: Our treatment is designed to minimize any risk of scarring. We use the most advanced technology and specific protocols that respect your skin's integrity, allowing it to look natural once the tattoo is removed
  - pregunta: What aftercare do I need?
    respuesta: Post-treatment care is simple but important. We'll provide you with a detailed guide that includes avoiding direct sun exposure for 15 days, keeping the area hydrated, and applying specific products we'll recommend. Most of our patients resume normal activities within 24-48 hours
  - pregunta: Why choose Dr. Tatiana Leal for my treatment?
    respuesta: We specialize exclusively in laser treatments and have the most advanced technology in the market. Our team is certified and updated on the latest tattoo removal techniques. Plus, we design a personalized plan for each patient, guaranteeing the best possible results
