faqs:
  - pregunta: How many sessions will I need?
    respuesta: The number of sessions varies depending on hair type and treatment area. Generally, 6-8 initial sessions are recommended, spaced 4-6 weeks apart, for optimal results. During your consultation, we'll evaluate your specific case and provide a personalized treatment plan
  - pregunta: Is the procedure painful?
    respuesta: No. Our diode laser technology incorporates an advanced cooling system that makes the treatment virtually painless. Most of our patients describe feeling cool sensations and mild tingling, but no pain. The procedure is much more comfortable than waxing or shaving
  - pregunta: Are the results permanent?
    respuesta: Yes, laser hair removal offers permanent results. The laser destroys the hair follicle, preventing future hair growth. After the initial protocol, some people may require occasional maintenance sessions due to hormonal changes, but hair reduction is permanent
  - pregunta: Is it safe for all skin types?
    respuesta: Yes, our diode laser technology is safe and effective for all skin types, even sensitive or tanned skin. The integrated cooling system protects your skin while the laser targets the hair follicle, ensuring safe and effective results
  - pregunta: How long does each session take?
    respuesta: Duration varies by treatment area. For example, underarms take only 10 minutes, while full legs may take up to 45 minutes. The treatment is quick and efficient, allowing you to immediately return to your daily activities
  - pregunta: What aftercare do I need?
    respuesta: Post-treatment care is minimal. We recommend avoiding direct sun exposure for 48 hours, using sunscreen, and keeping the skin hydrated. You can resume normal activities immediately after treatment
